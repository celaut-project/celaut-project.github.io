# *Celaut*: A peer-to-peer architecture for software design and distribution

<br>

**Context**

In the 1940s, mathematician John von Neumann, in collaboration with Stanislaw Ulam, introduced the concept of cellular automata, creating models that demonstrated how complex behaviors could emerge from simple rules. Building on this foundation, in 1970, John Horton Conway introduced "The Game of Life," a cellular automaton that became a classic example of how a system could evolve into intricate patterns from basic interactions. These ideas offer valuable insights into how decentralized systems can achieve complexity without central control, which serves as a guiding philosophy for the design of *Celaut*.

**Definition**

*Celaut* is a set of simple rules for software design and distribution, aiming to create a robust, scalable, and adaptive system through the principles of **decentralization**, **simplicity**, and **determinism**.

**Principles**

1. **Decentralization**: No single point of control or failure, allowing nodes to communicate and coordinate dynamically.
2. **Simplicity**: Minimalistic rules that reduce complexity, ensuring each component can be understood and maintained easily.
3. **Determinism**: Services behave predictably, following defined rules that ensure reproducibility of outcomes across different nodes.

***Celaut* Architecture: Nodes and Services**

*Celaut*’s architecture is built around two core elements: **nodes** and **services**. Together, they create a distributed network where each part contributes to the overall functionality, much like the agents in a cellular automaton.

- **Nodes**: 
    A node represents a computer or device within the *Celaut* network that can communicate with other nodes and manage the execution of services. The decentralized nature of *Celaut* is embodied in how nodes interact, ensuring no single point of failure or centralized control. Key responsibilities of a node include:
  
    1. **Service Execution**: Nodes manage service instances, deciding whether to run them locally or distribute the load across peer nodes. This ensures optimal resource utilization and performance, similar to how cells in a cellular automaton interact with their neighbors to maintain system balance.
    
    2. **Communication Interface**: A robust interface ensures seamless data exchange between nodes and services, allowing for effective coordination. Notably, nodes do not need to agree on a specific communication protocol beforehand, as the interface abstracts these details, allowing flexibility in interactions. This feature is further explained in detail below.
    
    3. **Address and Token Provisioning**: Nodes facilitate secure interactions by managing communication addresses and authentication tokens, making services easily accessible while maintaining security.
    
    4. **Dependency Management**: Nodes ensure that services have access to their required dependencies. These dependencies, often referred to as "child services," can run on the same or different nodes. This feature enables a parent service to access and coordinate with its child services, ensuring a smooth and efficient service ecosystem, even as services are distributed across the network.

    An implementation example of a node using Python3 and Rust is **Nodo** [here](https://github.com/*Celaut*-project/nodo).

- **Services**:
    A service in *Celaut* is a deterministic software container designed to perform a specific task. Following the **black box** principle, services operate independently of the details of the nodes that execute them, focusing solely on their functionality. Key aspects of services include:
  
    - **Execution as Isolated Instances**: When a user requests a service, it is sent to a node, which runs it as an isolated process—either in a container or a virtual machine, depending on the node’s architecture. This abstraction aligns with the principle of **simplicity**, as services do not need to be aware of the execution environment.
    
    - **Deterministic Behavior**: Services follow predefined rules to ensure consistent outcomes. This aligns with *Celaut*'s emphasis on **determinism**, where given the same inputs, a service will always produce the same output, regardless of which node executes it.
    
    - **Hierarchical Execution**: A unique characteristic of services in *Celaut* is their ability to request the execution of other services (child services) through the node, enabling complex workflows. This mirrors the emergent behaviors seen in cellular automata, where simple interactions can lead to more sophisticated patterns.

**Coordinating Incentives: Reputation and Payments**

In decentralized systems like *Celaut*, coordination is not just about technical interactions—it also involves aligning the incentives of all participants to ensure that the system functions effectively. *Celaut* incorporates two key mechanisms to achieve this alignment:

- **Reputation Systems**: 
    Each node and service can build a reputation based on its history of interactions. Nodes and services are incentivized to maintain high standards of reliability and quality to preserve their reputation. A strong reputation encourages other nodes and users to trust and interact with them, providing a natural incentive to behave fairly and provide quality services. This reputation mechanism creates a form of self-regulation within the network, where participants have a vested interest in maintaining their good standing.

- **Payment Mechanisms**: 
    Beyond reputation, cooperation between nodes and services is also facilitated through payment systems. When a node executes a service or when services interact with each other, compensation can be exchanged for resources used or tasks completed. These payments create a direct incentive for nodes to contribute resources and for services to deliver value, encouraging collaboration and fair exchanges across the network. Payment mechanisms ensure that resource allocation is efficient, allowing nodes and services to operate based on their strengths and capacities.

These mechanisms are described in more detail later, providing the economic framework that ensures the viability of *Celaut*’s decentralized approach. Similarly to how two nodes communicate without needing to agree on a specific protocol, these systems operate independently of the core architecture. The rationale behind this separation, and the way it allows flexibility and adaptability in interactions, is further explained below.

**Bridging the Conceptual and Practical**

The design of *Celaut* reflects the underlying principles of cellular automata: simple rules at the node and service level lead to a complex, adaptive system. By decentralizing control, simplifying interactions, and ensuring deterministic behavior, *Celaut* creates a flexible framework for software distribution and automation. This allows services to focus on their core functions while nodes manage the orchestration and distribution, leading to a system that can adapt and scale as new requirements emerge.

**Real-World Impact of *Celaut***

The architecture of *Celaut* enables faster iteration and experimentation, much like running simulations in a controlled environment. This makes it particularly valuable for scenarios where rapid deployment and testing of new methods are crucial. With the capabilities provided by modern computing, *Celaut* can leverage these principles to simulate complex systems in ways that were previously unimaginable, offering new ways to improve efficiency and performance in various industries.

This architecture allows services to focus on their functionality, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Nodes, for their part, can efficiently manage the execution of instances, without worrying about their usefulness.

## How a Service is Specified?

The specification of a service in *Celaut* consists of three main components:

### Container | *BOX*
The **BOX** component defines the environment in which the service will run, ensuring consistency in how the service is executed across different nodes. Unlike other containerization methods, *Celaut*’s BOX does not rely on external images or repositories; instead, it directly specifies the entire file structure needed to execute the service. It includes the following details:

- **Architecture**: Specifies the microarchitecture of the hardware that the service is intended to run on, ensuring compatibility between the service and the executing node.

- **Filesystem**: The filesystem is a comprehensive description of the service's file structure, encapsulating all the files and directories needed for the service to operate. This includes binaries, libraries, configuration files, and any other necessary resources. 
    - **Item Branches** define the structure of the filesystem, with each branch representing a file, a symbolic link, or a nested directory structure. 
    - This approach allows the entire environment to be self-contained, reducing reliance on third-party repositories and maintaining **determinism**, as the service's execution environment remains the same regardless of the host node.

- **Environment Variables**: Specifies key-value pairs that the service can access during runtime, allowing dynamic configuration without altering the core file structure.

- **Entrypoint**: Defines the script or command that initiates the service's main process when executed. This ensures the node knows how to start the service properly.

- **Config**: This includes configuration paths and formats that the node should load when starting the service. It provides necessary information like initial resource allocations or specific runtime parameters.

- **Expected Gateway**: Describes how the service communicates with the *Celaut* node, specifying the protocols and methods (gateway app protocol) it expects from the node. This component ensures smooth communication between the service and its host environment, treating the node like an operating system that provides system-level interactions.

The BOX specification allows *Celaut* services to be portable, reproducible, and free from third-party dependencies, aligning with the principles of **simplicity** and **determinism**.

### Interface | *API*
The *API* (Application Programming Interface) in Celaut is the set of rules and specifications that define how clients and other services can interact with a service within the ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to establish a clear and consistent method for different software components to communicate with each other, ensuring that services are accessible and usable in a predictable manner.

Through the *API*, communication protocols and endpoints are defined for a service to receive and process requests. This ensures that any external entity, whether a user or another service, can integrate with the service by following a standardized set of instructions without needing to understand its internal workings.

A fundamental aspect of the *API* in Celaut is its role in decentralization. By providing a well-defined interface, services can operate autonomously without relying on a centralized controller to manage interactions. This allows the system to be more scalable and resilient, as each service is self-sufficient in its ability to communicate and collaborate with other components of the ecosystem.

The *API* specification allows services to be easily accessed and used by clients while maintaining a consistent method of interaction. It supports the **decentralization** principle of *Celaut* by allowing services to be self-sufficient in their communication without needing to rely on a centralized controller for protocol negotiation.

### Network | *NET*
The **NET** component defines the scope of external network access that a service can request and interact with. By default, a service is isolated from external networks, only able to communicate with its parent service (the client that created it), its child services, and the *Celaut* node that executes it. This isolation ensures **determinism** and enhances **security** by preventing unauthorized data leaks or interactions.

However, some services require access to external networks for their functionality. For example, a service that acts as a Bitcoin node needs to interact with the broader Bitcoin network. To enable this without compromising security, *Celaut* allows the following:

- **Controlled External Access**: The service does not directly access external IP addresses or nodes. Instead, it sends a request to its *Celaut* node, specifying its need for access to a particular network (e.g., "bitcoin-mainnet"). The *Celaut* node then verifies and provides a list of trusted peer nodes that the service can interact with.
  
- **Service Request for Network Peers**: A service like a Bitcoin node may request additional resources or network peers by communicating with its *Celaut* node. For example, it might request, "I need peers from 'bitcoin-mainnet'." The node evaluates this request and returns a list of verified instances (which may be other Bitcoin nodes running as services on the *Celaut* network).

- **Node Awareness and Redirection**: If the *Celaut* node that received the service request knows it cannot find suitable peers (e.g., no other Bitcoin nodes in its network), it will look for a peer *Celaut* node that can fulfill this requirement. This ensures that services can always find the necessary network connections, even if the initial *Celaut* node is limited.

The **NET** component allows *Celaut* to balance the need for external connectivity with the core values of **security** and **determinism**, ensuring that services remain isolated unless explicitly permitted to access broader networks.

<br><br>

The specification of a service is a key part of the *Celaut* architecture, as it allows services to be deployed and executed in a consistent and predictable manner. 

<br>

The node will load the service from the binary and provide it with the resources it needs to run.

There is no single way to define a service.
For example, [Proto3 implementation](https://github.com/*Celaut*-project/service-lib/blob/master/node-driver/src/node_driver/gateway/protos/*Celaut*.proto#L66) is one of many possible variations.

<br>

Not all nodes will accept all possible variations of a service specification.

>For example, node A understands a specific proto3 specification and one in JSON. Another node B understands the JSON specification and another in JSON+zip file system. Both nodes can transmit services of the specification they have in common, in this case, JSON.

<br>

## Different types of role users on the system

As users, we can play three types of roles:

- Node maintainer (similar to someone maintaining a miner in a blockchain).
- Service developer. These can be run by anyone on any node (any compatible node, in terms of architecture, etc.).
- Users who launch services on nodes.

Therefore, the person maintaining a node (type 1 user) doesn’t concern themselves with whether it’s mining PoW, running a trading bot, analyzing a DNA sequence, or whatever the services it runs do. They simply execute the services that type 3 users request, in exchange for proof of payment (on a blockchain or whatever method of payment is accepted). The developer (type 2 user) only needs to send it to one or multiple nodes, and these will handle distributing the service among others and/or uploading it to a reputation system,  so that users (or other services) know if use it and when and why to use it.

>This is a simple view of the system, by introducing more complexity the amount of possible user roles could also grow

## Following Nature's Footsteps in Digital Ecosystems

Imagine *Celaut* as a digital ecosystem, mirroring the dynamics of a biological ecosystem found in nature. In this analogy:

1. Nodes as Organisms: Nodes within *Celaut* can be likened to organisms in a natural ecosystem. Each node represents a distinct entity with its own capabilities and functions, akin to different species occupying various niches in the environment. These nodes interact with each other, forming a network akin to the interconnected web of life found in ecosystems.

2. Services as Biological Functions: Services within *Celaut* are analogous to biological functions or processes found in organisms. Each service performs a specific task, similar to how organs in living organisms carry out specialized functions. Just as organs work together harmoniously to sustain life, services collaborate within nodes to fulfill diverse computational needs.

3. Decentralization as Diversity: The decentralization principle of *Celaut* can be equated with biodiversity in natural ecosystems. In nature, biodiversity ensures resilience and adaptability, as diverse species contribute to ecosystem stability and functionality. Similarly, decentralization in *Celaut* mitigates risks associated with single points of failure and enhances the system's ability to adapt to changing conditions.

4. Efficiency as Energy Optimization: Efficiency in *Celaut* mirrors the energy optimization observed in natural systems. In biological ecosystems, energy flows through food webs, with organisms optimizing energy expenditure to maximize survival and reproduction. Likewise, *Celaut* optimizes computational resources, distributing tasks across nodes to minimize latency and resource wastage.

5. Simplicity and Determinism as Natural Laws: The principles of simplicity and determinism in *Celaut* resonate with the underlying laws governing natural systems. Just as physical laws dictate the behavior of matter and energy in the universe, *Celaut*'s simple rules govern the interactions between nodes and services. This deterministic framework ensures consistency and predictability, analogous to the predictability of natural phenomena governed by fundamental laws.

<br>


## Trust systems

In *Celaut*, the different parts of the system, nodes and services, do not trust each other, therefore it is a trustless system. This is why it is unlikely that a node will execute services for free, or that a service will not work without making a payment in a contract and receiving proof of it (although obviously they can do it if they want, in the case of services it is economically feasible because they have a marginal cost of zero). 
<br>However, to allow interaction between these parts without trust between them, contracts, social contracts (in a society of nodes and services), are needed to transmit value and assign reputation to each part. Therefore, we have two types of systems (from a relatively abstract point of view): payment systems and reputation systems.

> A possible strategy for a node is to offer the execution of services without exchanging value at the beginning, to increase its reputation and, when it has reputation from others, start to increase its cost.

> Unlike nodes, the nature of services is to have a marginal cost of zero, this means that they do not have a limit on the number of simultaneous units in which they are executed (since the cost of executing them falls on the nodes), so it is quite likely that many services will start with a cost of zero to gain reputation, require a cost when they have reputation and remain competitive, and return to a cost of zero when they cease to be competitive.


### Payment systems

Payment systems allow for the transfer of value between entities in *Celaut*. Here are some possible types:

#### License Smart Contracts

A contract system that allows for the issuance of usage licenses for services and nodes, where Ledger is the network where truth is agreed upon. In this way, if A wants to execute a method of B, it will check its contract, execute the defined command (connecting to the Ledger), and the Ledger's contract will issue a license, which A will send to B to enable it to execute the desired method.

There are four distinct types of licenses based on two different classifications. On one hand, whether the license is elastic or static, and on the other, whether it is interactive or non-interactive.

- **Elastic licenses** are those that allow for the restriction of their usage based on certain parameters (number of requests, time, methods, environment variables, etc.).

- **Static licenses** are those that do not restrict usage. B knows the license keys, and the contract provides the license without being able to limit its usage.

- **Interactive licenses** require B to connect to the Ledger to verify the validity of the provided license.

- **Non-interactive** licenses do not require B to connect to the Ledger to verify the validity of the provided license.

<br>

This results in the four types of licenses:

- Interactive static (Very straightforward - Not very useful)
- Non-interactive static (Better for services)
- Interactive elastic (Better for nodes)
- Non-interactive elastic (Quite complex - Versatile)

<br>

> Ledgers can be public and permissionless networks like Bitcoin or Ergo, or private closed platforms like Stripe. The only requirement is that all participants must support them.

<br>


### Reputation systems

Reputation systems allow users, nodes, and services to create a social ecosystem upon which to make decisions. For nodes, they need to know which peers they can trust to request the execution of services. 
For users, who execute services, it helps them determine which services will perform best for the task they wish to carry out.

In *Celaut*, reputation is represented as records on Ledgers, which represent an opinion.

In the case of services, their deterministic nature provides a different perspective on their reputation compared to nodes. 
A reputation proof (a record) published some time ago may hold the same value as a current one regarding a service (this is true when the service does not interact with networks, which is the default form of a service, completely isolated). 
If it does interact with any network, its reputation may depend on the reputation of the networks it connects to, which does not have that deterministic property, as it can change over time. This is because the service itself has not changed.

However, the reputation of a node is more valuable the more recent it is, as its behavior can vary over time. 
When nodes present themselves to each other, they show proofs of their reputation, and others may opine non-consensually on whether they are more or less trustworthy.

Each node, service, or other type of actor in a reputation system trusts various sources to varying degrees, and these sources, in turn, trust different sources, nodes, services, or other entities to varying degrees. Thus, when a certain actor is presented with an unknown entity, they will check the opinions of their trusted sources.

For a more specific understanding of how a reputation system works, you can read: [Sigma Reputation Panel Documentation](https://github.com/reputation-systems/sigma-reputation-panel/blob/master/README.md)

<br>


## Why is this necessary

*Celaut* intend to solve is precisely the separation between the “*how to solve a problem*” and the “*where and who solve it*”.

Take, for example, a trading bot.

>Trading bots are automated software programs that execute buy and sell orders in financial markets based on predefined algorithms. They are important as they can operate 24/7, react quickly to market changes, and remove emotional biases, enhancing efficiency and consistency in trading strategies.


<br>

In this context, if you want to use a trading bot right now, You will go to the web and can:

1. Look for a web service that will manage your asset portfolio, which has:
    1. Advantages:
        1. You don’t need to run the infrastructure yourself.
        2. You don’t need to configure anything.
    2. Disadvantages:
        1. You can’t attribute reputation to it because the developer of the web
        service is unable to prove that the system hasn’t changed (for example,
        when a bot has gained a large number of users, they might reduce
        its performance to encourage you to use a newer one).
        2. The developers of the web service can’t assure you that they aren’t
        misusing the data from your requests (in this case, the
        movements of your portfolio).
2. Search for a source code (on GitHub, etc.) that you can run on your PC (or in the cloud) on your own.
    1. Advantages:
        1. It’s deterministic, in the sense that (if it can’t connect to the
        internet) you’ll be sure that its behavior and/or performance won’t change in the future, because the developer can't modify the source that you previously downloaded.
        2. The developer of the service has no control over the data of your requests.
    2. Disadvantages:
        1. You need to possess equipment (infrastructure) capable of running the code.
        2. You have to deal with system configuration issues (which are often
        significant enough for an average user to opt for a web service).

In contra part of this two options, *Celaut* allows to take the advangates of the two previous solutions without their disadvantages. There’s why:



- Infrastructure management is unnecessary, as the nodes handle it. There is no need to seek out a cloud provider.

- No configuration is required. The specification service covers how the container is built, its architecture, its network requirements, and its interface. Users do not need to be concerned about any of this.

- Service developers cannot control, modify, or extract data from the service. They do not control the nodes that distribute and run it. However, they may be incentivized to create it.
